A Spotify clone which have the replica Ui as spotify and Spotify Api used for database.

## Getting Started

This is a Flutter Spotify Application which is created using flutter,dart,[Getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for state management,[Spotify Live Api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/) and other third party flutter packages. I made this app to showcase my Ui skills and API handling skills and also to see to which extent flutter can go. ### I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
